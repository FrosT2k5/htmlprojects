        <h1>Linus Torvalds - Creator of Linux</h1>
        <p>Linus is one of the most influential programmer ever born, he is the creator of Linux Kernel, the technology that drives most of the technology in today's world, right from your mobile handsets to largest datacenters on earth! Yet most of us are obvilious of Linus Torvald's work and it goes underappreciated. He made the best software in the world, and he made sure that it's free and transparent</p>

                <p>Linux kernel is the heart of all Linux based distros and Android, it was created by Linus Torvalds
                in year 1991, now GNU/Linux based distros are one of the most used operating systems due to it's capablities and powers. Linux is maintained by open source community and it supports wide range of devices and is constantly updated for security improvements and new features</p>

            <div class="project2grid">
                <p>To support Linux Development, Torvalds made another project that is git. It is widely used by almost all organisations, from small startups to huge MNCs. It is used to manage the versions of source code, store commits so that they can be reverted and rebased on occurence of bugs. It is extremely useful when multiple people are working on same projects, they can make changes and merge those changes easily using git commands. The most jawdropping thing is that he made git in just 10 days!</p>
